The goal of this project was to develop a modular pipeline for the analysis of calcium imaging data. The project is structured so that novice users can interact at a high level using simple function calls, while more experience programmers can interact and augment lower level functionality.


The INSTALLATION section will get you up and running with python and fleappy. The COOKBOOK will walk you through the analysis of an example data set.
