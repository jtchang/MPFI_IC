Getting Help
------------

The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the gitter chat room |gitter|.

The other good way is to open an issue on Github.

Contributing
------------



We are happy to have new functionality added by others to fleappy. If you would like to contribute, we asked that you format your code to the best of your ability using the :pep:`8` standard. Docstrings should be in the `google-docstring`_ format (this allows our API documentation to be consistent).

You may then submit a pull-request on Github to have your code integrated into fleappy.
